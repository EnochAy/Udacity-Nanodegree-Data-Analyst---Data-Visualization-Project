## By Ayomide (Enoch) Fadeyi


## Prosper Loan Data

> Prosper Loan Dataset contains information on peer to peer loans facilitated by Prosper, a credit company.
There are 113937 rows/observations and 81 columns/features in this dataset.
For the purpoe of this project, as a result of the large numbers of features in this dataset, 81 in total, 
I will not be able to use all these. I will be focusing on parts of these:

Term, LoanStatus, BorrowerRate, ProsperRating (Alpha), ListingCategory (numeric), 
EmploymentStatus, DelinquenciesLast7Years, StatedMonthlyIncome, TotalProsperLoans, 
LoanOriginalAmount, LoanOriginationDate, Recommendations, Investors. 


## Summary of Findings

> ## Conclusions  
> ### Summary
*** My initial assumptions were strengthened. Most of the defaulted credits comes from individuals with low Prosper rating and Business category tend to have larger amount.

*** The employed tend to complete their loans than the unemployed


### What are the main driving factors of outcome of loan?
The main driving factors of outcome of loan from the analysis conducted in the project include the following:
1. Employment
2. Prosper Rating
3. Business Category

### Steps taken during my data exploration.
1. Question: The first step I took to conduct this project is to pose a general research question. From this one question, several other questions were asked and answered.
2. Analyse: Next, I used different libraries and functions to analyse the data in a bid to proffer answers to the questions posed.
3. Visualize: Then, I moved on to visualizing the data to aid comprehension and understanding of the findings from my analysis.
4. Observation: Lastly, I point out and explain my observations and findings to each of this question.


## Key Insights for Presentation
